FitMe Website 
A robust and dynamic web Application with highly interactive frontend and backend.
The backend is powered by PHP and interacts with a MySQL database to store and retrieve data dynamically. The frontend communicates with the backend, fetching data from the database in real-time, which ensures that the application is always displaying the latest information.
All necessary information is loaded and displayed dynamically on the same page, ensuring a fast and efficient interaction. The dynamic data fetching from the backend eliminates the need for complex page transitions, making the website faster and more responsive.
